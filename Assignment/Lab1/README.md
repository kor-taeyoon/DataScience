Lab assignment #1: Python coding exercise


- Define your own problem based on the two datasets we explored in class (airports.dat and routes.dat)

  Note that there are many more features (columns) in the datasets.

- Solve the problem using Python programming

- Display the results of your problem using graphs (using Matplotlib.pyplot or Seaborn library)

- Everything should be in the Notebook file (no separated documentation required)


Due date: one week from now
