That had a lot to do with why NASA would not or did not want to approve them for man carry.  On the flip side, it had its nice points too.  Having grown up in the aerospace companies from the Saturn V, Mercury, B2, and so many other programs it was nice to see a manufacturing environment not controlled by a Union.

Prior to SpaceX, I was earning $70/hour (which is high). I came on to SpaceX at around half that rate per hour, but the promise of working 50 to 60 hours her week compensated for the lower hourly rate. After around 2 years of service, SpaceX cut all hours down to a maximum of 40 per week. This was a real gut punch financially. Without the 50+ hours, the job just did not compare to what my industry averages were. Sadly, and I mean sadly, I resigned from SpaceX in order to autocorrect my pay and earnings. The company is yet young and finding its footing. NASA and many in government may not want privatized space businesses to succeed.

The only issue I have is all employees aren't college educated, some of us learned on the job.  Although I spent 10 years there at the end I was made to feel like they wanted new younger employees that went to college.  When Spacex started it was experienced aerospace workers that got them off the ground and now they don't want to be affiliated with aerospace.  Even the job that I had (manufacturing planner) they want performed by educated engineers instead of experienced planners who grew from inside the company.  If I spent 20 years being a machinist what better person tho write instructions for machining the an employee that was a machinist.  That's my only gripe otherwise it is a great place to work.\n",
